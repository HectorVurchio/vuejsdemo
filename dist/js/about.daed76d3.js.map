Along with the framework, some\n      libraries such as N-Progress, Axios and Chartjs were necessary to help\n      with the application building. Of course, should be highlighted the fact\n      that JavaScript and CSS knowledge was important to carry on some tasks\n      related with Vue handling.\n    </p>\n    <h2>The Server Side</h2>\n    <p>\n      The server side or backend is an API REST coded in PHP 8.5.1, using PHP\n      libraries such as Phpspreadsheet and aws who helped with the Excel files\n      opening and uploading respectively, running within an httpd 2.4 Web\n      Server. The data provided by the form in the client side is stored in an\n      Oracle JSON data base along with the name and extensions of each Excel\n      file. The case of the Excel file itself is not stored in the data base,\n      whereby the Oracle Object Storage is employed for such purpose.\n    </p>\n    <h2>The Infrastructure</h2>\n    <p>\n      The infrastructure schema over which the said backend lays over, is\n      depicted in the picture below and is provided by Oracle Cloud\n      Infrastructure as a free tear product being this useful to test some\n      applications or deploying demos as is the case of this application.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Our backend is running in an Oracle-Linux server 8.5 virtual machine\n      aarch64 provided by Oracle as well as other services here used such as\n      Oracle JSON data base and Oracle Object Storage where the form data and MS\n      Excel files are stored respectively. All those services lastly mentioned\n      are offered by Oracle as a free sample of its products, this means that\n      the whole backend is running by paying $0. Other services as SSL\n      certificate and public domain name service run by account of third party\n      providers such as <a href=\"https://www.zerossl.com\">ZeroSSL.com</a> and\n      <a href=\"https://www.no-ip.com\">No-IP.com</a> as a free trial.\n    </p>\n    <img id=\"about-img\" />\n    <h2>The Repository</h2>\n    <p>\n      All the code written here was laid out in a public repository for its\n      front end in GitHub whose name is\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/HectorVurchio/vuejsdemo\">vuejsdemo</a> and\n      deployed its distribution folder in\n      <a href=\"https://www.render.com\">render.com</a> page.
